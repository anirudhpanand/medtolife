    <h2> Common Medical Terms: </h2>
    <div class="container">
    <ul>
        <li> Cell: The basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known organisms. A cell is the smallest unit of life. Cells are often called the "building blocks of life". The study of cells is called cell biology, or cellular biology, or cytology. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Cell Organelle: A specialized subunit, usually within a cell, that has a specific function. The name organelle comes from the idea that these structures are parts of cells, as organs are to the body.  </li>
        <br>
        <p> <b> Now, let's learn about the various organs in our body: </b> </p>
        <br>
        <li> Cell Membrane: A biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment (the extracellular space) which protects the cell from its environment. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Nucleolus: The largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Nucleus: A membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. It consists of nucleolus, nucleoplasm, chromosomes, DNA, genes, etc. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Ribosome: Macromolecular machines, found within all living cells, that perform biological protein synthesis. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Vesicle: A structure within or outside a cell, consisting of liquid or cytoplasm enclosed by a lipid bilayer. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Nuclear Matrix: The network of fibres found throughout the inside of a cell nucleus and is somewhat analogous to the cell cytoskeleton. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Cytoskeleton: A complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria and archaea. It extends from the cell nucleus to the cell membrane and is composed of similar proteins in the various organisms. In eukaryotes, it is composed of three main components, microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules, and these are all capable of rapid growth or disassembly dependent on the cell's requirements </li>
        <br>
        <li> Skin: Skin is the layer of usually soft, flexible outer tissue covering the body of a vertebrate animal, with three main functions: protection, regulation, and sensation. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Pulse: The tactile arterial palpation of the cardiac cycle by trained fingertips. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Pulse Rate: The amount of pulse in a minute. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Blood Pressure: The pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels. Blood pressure is of two types: diastolic, and systolic. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Diastolic blood pressure: The diastolic reading, or the bottom number, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. <br> This is the time when the heart fills with blood and gets oxygen. A normal diastolic blood pressure is lower than 80 mm of Hg. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Systolic blood pressure: The systolic reading, or the upper number, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts to push blood. <br> This is the time when the chambers of the heart, filled with blood (the ventricles), pump the oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. A normal systolic pressure is below 120 mm of Hg. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Heart: It is the basic blood - pumping organ in animals. It consists of two kinds of chambers: the auricle (or the atrium, plural: atria) and the ventricle (plural: ventricles). These are differentiated as the left atria and the left ventricles and the right atria and the right ventricles. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Blood vessels: A system of tubes which carry blood (both oxygenated and deoxygenated) throughout the body. They are classified as arteries (carrying oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, through which it gets pumped to the whole body) and veins (carrying deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body to the heart, through which it is pumped to the lungs to throw out the carbon di - oxide and get the blood oxygenated). <br> All the veins, except for the pulmonary vein (carrying oxygenated blood) carry deoxygenated blood and all the arteries, except for the pulmonary artery (carrying deoxygenated blood) carry oxygenated blood. </li>
        <br>
        <b> Fact: Aorta is the largest artery in the body. </b>
        <br>
        <li> Septum (part of the heart): It is the part dividing the left and right chambers of the heart, also extending as the wall of the heart. The septum is present between the left and right chambers of the heart to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which is especially important in animals with high energy and temparatue requirements. </li>
        <br>
        <b> Did You Know? <br> The walls of the ventricles are thicker than the walls of the atria. This is so, because the ventricles have to push the blood to the whole body, thus requiring more power, pressure and force, when compared to the atria. </b>
        <br>
        <li> Lung(s): They are the organs which help in breathing in terrestrial organisms. They are a part of the respiratory system. </li>
        <br>
        <b> Fact: The left lung has a cut - out to accomodate the heart (above it).  </b>
        <br>
        <li> Nose: It is the organ which helps in taking in oxygen rich air into our lungs, or throw out the deoxygenated air from the lungs, through the trachea. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Trachea: Also known as the windpipe, the trachea carries oxygenated air from the nose to the lungs and deoxygenated blood from the lungs to the nose. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Bronchus (plural: Bronchi): The part of the trachea which travels into the lungs, gets divided in called bronchus. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Bronchioles: The bronchus gets further divided into bronchioles. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Alveolus (plural: Alveoli): Tiny air - sacs present in the lungs, surrounded by blood capillaries for the exchange of gases, are known as alveoli. The bronchioles further branch into alveoli in the lungs. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Mouth: It is the organ which takes in food. It contains the tongue, teeth (singular: tooth), saliva, salivary glands. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Tongue: It is a muscular, flap - like organ, which helpsin chewing and mixing the food (known as bolus after being grinded by the teeth) with the saliva. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Teeth: They are the organs </li>
